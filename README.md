## Introduction
Our project harnesses the power of geolocation technology to identify and connect potential blood donors in real-time. Through a user-friendly interface, users can register their availability and blood type. Recipients can search for suitable donors based on their location and blood type requirements.

## Problem Statement
In times of urgency, individuals frequently turn to social media platforms to request assistance, particularly for critical blood donations. These requests often take the form of image posts or short status updates. However, relying on images or vague messages can be ineffective and inefficient in connecting those in need with potential donors. Furthermore, such methods may not provide relevant details such as blood type required or precise location, leading to delays or mismatches in assistance.

Our goal is to address these shortcomings by developing a solution that enables swift and accurate connections between individuals requiring urgent aid and nearby resources, independent of images or ambiguous messages. This solution aims to streamline the process of requesting and offering assistance during emergencies, ultimately saving time and potentially lives.

## Project Solution
- The idea is to build an app where users can register details such as blood type and health-related information, and set their visibility as required.
- If a user needs urgent blood, they simply search for available donors with just a click. As the search begins, all donors in the proximity of the recipient get notified if their visibility is set to be visible.
- Once a request is accepted, the donor and recipient are connected, and the further process continues.

## Features
- **User Registration:** Users can register their details, including blood type and health-related information.
- **Geolocation-Based Search:** Recipients can search for donors based on their location and blood type.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Donors in the proximity of the recipient get notified in real-time.
- **Connection Interface:** Allows donors and recipients to connect and communicate seamlessly.

## How to Use
1. **Register:** Sign up on the app and enter your details, including your blood type and any relevant health information.
2. **Set Visibility:** Choose your visibility settings to control when you can be contacted.
3. **Search for Donors:** If you need blood, use the search feature to find donors nearby who match your blood type.
4. **Receive Notifications:** Donors in your area will be notified of your request.
5. **Connect:** Once a donor accepts your request, you can connect and arrange the blood donation.
