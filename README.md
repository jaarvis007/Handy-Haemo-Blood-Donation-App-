**Introduction:**
-Our project will harness the power of geolocation technology to identify and connect potential blood donors in real-time.
-Through a user-friendly interface, users can register their availability and blood type.
-Recipient can search for suitable donors based on their location and blood type requirements.


**Problem Statement:**
In times of urgency, individuals frequently turn to social media platforms to request assistance, particularly for critical blood donations. These requests often take the form of image posts or short status updates. However, relying on images or vague messages can be ineffective and inefficient in connecting those in need with potential donors. Furthermore, such methods may not provide relevant details such as blood type required or precise location, leading to delays or mismatches in assistance. Our goal is to address these shortcomings by developing a solution that enables swift and accurate connections between individuals requiring urgent aid and nearby resources, independent of images or ambiguous messages. This solution aims to streamline the process of requesting and offering assistance during emergencies, ultimately saving time and potentially lives.


**Project have a solution:**
-The idea is to build an app on which a user can register details like blood type, and health-related details and set their visibility required.
-If a user need urgent blood, he has to just search for the available donors in just a click, and as search started all the donors in the proximity of recipient get notified if their visibility is set to be visible.
-As the request got accepted, donor and recipient got connected and further  process will be continued.
